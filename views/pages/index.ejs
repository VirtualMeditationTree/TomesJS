              Alluring Aura Overview
            </button>
            <p>
              Electro - magnetism was discovered a long time ago, in the form of an aura, Auras have different forms and are organized by color.

              if you activate levels 1 - 7 your aura is labeled as a rainbow, this means you have a continuous surge of energy through every corridor of your brain simultaneously.

              Within the Kundalini realm that aura spreads through the air, the raw power essentially evaporates the chemicals of each corridor accept unlike mist it doesn’t settle and unlike real evaporation it stays around you, it is a part of you and others can feel the magnetic shifts.

              Auras Amplify, this is known as Aura Amplification, the human brain consists of 3 main sections, Body, Soul and Mind.

              when a new brain is born and begins the early stages of development the :

              Body is at level 1,
              Soul is at level 1,
              Mind is at level 1,



              as we begin to develop from our first steps we all reach an equal level,

              Body is at level 10,
              Soul is at level 10,
              Mind is at level 10,

              Body Is multiplied by the mind which =’s 100, and is then multiplied by the soul which =’s 1,000 which is the power of our natural aura.


              lets say a 1,000 is the average score for an 18 year old, if you where to put the baby with the 18 year old, the 1 year old will not feel the aura, however the baby will and this will allow this newborn to possibly adapt faster over time.

              as we reach an older age of 80, we will reach a natural level of wisdom
              Body is at level 100,
              Soul is at level 100,
              Mind is at level 100,

              Body Multiplied by mind, and multiplied again by Soul 100x100x100= 1,000,000

              The Body and Mind are your own, After this timely process your aura will grow once the soul receives its portion of distributed growth.

              An aura is only able to be multiplied and amplified with another auras soul calibration.

              a room of only 100 level 1,000,000 can reach in the trillions squared, this amplification could possibly counter solar flares, and solar radiation.

              in an example there are 100 passengers on Flight A, traveling for 12 hours many of them especially at high altitudes start to purge their auras. If this flight was all teenagers the aura around Flight A would be significantly less, possibly only in the billions, that aura could reach out a few hundred feet and the solar flare could easily over power and cause a malfunction on Flight A.

              Flight B is full of 100, level 1,000,000 all reaching a peek performance of potentially 10,000,000 each due to pressure caused by altitude, more of our magnetized particles are released simultaneously as the shift in pressure effects all of the
              passengers at the same time. The solar flare has no chance, this aura’s simultaneous surge was so massive and short lived that it reached a level of 100 trillion squared 100 times. each square compounds 100 trillion squared is 100,000 trillions, multiplied by 100 trillion, reaching 10,000,000 trillions, this continues to amplify, reaching 2 miles in diameter, enough for a person 2 miles down to feel a slight presence. This Aura on Flight B counter acted a solar flare of radiation which projectiles from the sun after a million years of traveling from the suns core.

             Bright Beacon Overview
            </button>
              <p>
                We all have heard that its darkest before the dawn, its very true even the theory of the universe states light came around after enough cataclysms.

                Kundalini Meditation is the only form of dark and light meditation, Light meditation is explained as happy thoughts. Dark meditation is when the demons of our mind are set free to wreak havoc within a subconscious, Those of you who do not know what kundalini meditation is its explained as drug induced with kundalini stretches that release numbing chemicals within ones bodily neurological  receptors released by their brain.

                Dark Kundalini Meditation is how I explain a bad dream, once upon a time I fell into a meditative state laying down in a bad position. when someone is meditating their brain is moving at light speed because your body begins a form of hybernation where it lets your body parts shut off temporarily while it sends the excess energy to your brain. Dark Kundalini Meditation can be triggered consciously or subconsciously, people who have negative thoughts and fall into a meditative state spend more of their energy unknowingly fighting their demons rather than letting them dissipate.

                While in a subconscious kundalini state every part of your body and mind are active, Kundalini Meditation uses the most amount of energy and is considered one of the highest forms of meditation. Dreams are often mixed up with a Kundalini state because they replicate life from the deepest most accurate corridor of your brain, its considered a serious form of meditation that has both positive and negative psychological effects.

                Imagine waking up in your dream in your bed and thinking you are awake, Now imagine that you could control that dream and every existing element to come to mind. When you awake you see clearly it was unreal, although within the psychological realm a brain only has so many ways of knowing its in too deep or not deep enough. These are known as psychological bread crumbs, a thought or concept that although its possible in the psychological realm you'll know its fake and if in a positive / negative state you can cause a specified corridor of your brain to trigger pain / fear receptors to escape a trap set by ones own subconscious.

                A 100% dark state is crafted within your mind, an artificial simulation of psychological endevors will be placed within your brain and you will walk though them like an obstacle course visited for the first time. Your energy rapidly decreases an unknown force tends to sap the life right out of you, almost a demon that is born of dry ice.

                Within Dark Kundalini being visited by dead relatives or friends / loved ones who have betrayed you will appear, in some cases deceased although they are fully alive. This is activated by anger, within Dark Kundalini your brain is owned by its emotions, in order to move through the obstacle course you must give into the dark side of your brain, this happens subconsciously and is a test to see if you can handle the darkest of dark before your energy is depleted and your entrance into the realm is cut short.

                Each moment is crafted based off of you and your corridors, since your brain is well your brain it has all the information it could ever need to create a horror story, one that is crafted of a calibrated  balance of chemical emotions direct from your basket of fears. From 1% dark to 100% dark each obstacle gradually gets worse until you are consumed by the demons that own the dark. Its nearly impossible to realize whats going on before the demon makes its first attack because when you start in dark kundalini it gives the feeling of 100% light, the next transition is to the 1% dark. This happens because our brains balance and scale everything based off of positive and negative experiences simultaneously.



                As one drifts and views their own demonic habitual thoughts the purpose begins to clarify, almost as a doorway you'll have the option to turn the knob and walk in. Although the curiosity isn't settled by sight, it will take a vigorous attack for you to awake. When you try to remember a dream a year after its happened information dissipates. Dark Kundalini Meditation results in Kundalini syndrome and the feeling and visual never goes away, some believe it actually is a demon walking you though the valley of death as it has been stated that seeing the future of time itself is by knowing the logical outcome from similar life experiences.

                Getting out of Dark Kundalini before the horrors begin is as easy as someone waking you up, your initial insertion starts prior to existing. This is a purgatorial state of mind that keeps you from seeing whats behind the curtain. Once the first fear is experienced a rush of feelings come to mind and you feel a brief rush and a brief amount of joy, within dark kundalini before each obstacle commences you'll feel a 100% since of light to assure you feel the torture you believe you deserve for the thoughts of dark desires.

             Cosmic Concoction Overview
            </button>
            <p>
              What is it to be created? We are formed and intertwined, while staying confined within our minds, are we the same type of concoction our universe made up for its very own survival? Are we not a parallel image, a mirrored creation of our own universe? We resemble everything, even if the concept is not identical from the front end, the back end mimics and follows the same trend, how is that even possible? A mind can retain only so much information, just as a blackhole can only absorb so much particle waste. It is concave and con-vexed, opening a gateway into its unquenchable stomach, our eyes are the same, a portal into the depths of our mind, we see the food, and before too long that food is being taken in.

              In order for one blackhole to exist, there has to be others. Our eyes are conjoined portals into one oblivion of thought. We take 2 beings to make one, is this not a mirrored cosmic concoction floating low, adapting rapidly for a genetic advantage? Maybe this is a coincidence, however science has proven to me all walks of life are relevant and mimic one another.

              2 Portals, sync one vessel, and open up countless receptor gateways. A Collision of insight, a massive swarm of chemical elements carefully crafted, contemplated before conjoined. Even though I assure you, our universe has its own X-factors.

              Take in a vivid vision with me, our universe is flat and resembles a sheet of glass. As the universe pulses, time ripples throughout this sheet of glass. Eventually such magnitude shatters this glass like sheet of universe, breaking into all different shapes and sizes starting to replicate a 3rd dimensional existence. These shards of time are incredibly vast, so vast, that the north end pieces with take millions of years to collide with the south ends pieces, by the time they even reach each other a wake of particles have steadily fallen behind, leaving a trail of unseen atoms. Eventually the friction will begin to burn, burn burn, and carefully sculpt the sharp edges, and melt away the perception of time.

              Our life cycle is tethered to day and night, in space time cycles for growth take a very, very long time. The results are much larger, our daily cycle allows a day of growth to take place, if our universe is rotating around something unforeseen, wouldn’t one day be a trillion years? Resulting in a trillion years of growth all at once? Time flux, a wave of atoms expanding, stretching the very fabric of our perception. What about day two? it’ll most certainly build up on the previous installations, polish out the kinks, and then continue moving forward with its primal instinct of surviving.

             Dim Dawn Overview
            </button>
            <p>

              All visions arise, after being formed they fall. Only to arise greater, brighter stronger all over again. A cycle of Positive and Negative, allowing great fluctuations resulting in something accumulating to a great accolade.

              Psychologically speaking jumping from positive to negative mindsets rapidly is unhealthy, a steady balance is key to the greatest innovations, our universe has taken that burden on all on its own, at least so it seems.

              Now, surely that precise balance we all seek has many prior variations, a simple solar flare can break away all of what holds us in balance, the reason for dawn is a diminishing concept, fire is the reason for that. Establishing a notion, that eventually we will not have our earths cycles, in which fire is telling us that we can still survive without cycles, it’ll just result in a diluted perception of existence, a warped reality. However human brains programmatically can replicate, deviate and assimilate this cycle in various ways.

              Spiritual Meditation is what I believe to be a direct link to the Spiritual Realm.

              An essence of our 100% pure realm founded and sustained by love, it can never be used for hate and is monitored by our inner guiding light which is actually embedded inside you're subconscious, find the corridor of your brain that does not physically exist and you'll be accepted into the kingdom of heaven.

              If you are cut short in this life and just flat out given the raw end of the deal, The next rebirth will have a set of blue prints to that spiritual corridor and with those blue prints you'll have the choice of true clairvoyance in consciousness rather than clairvoyance being controlled by the spiritual guardians known as angels. 

              If you are lucky in this life and you reach the spiritual corridor, you'll be given the option to meditate forever in heaven with all of the soldiers of god. But not locked into the realm, you'll always be able to partake again in the worlds of man.

              With the power of combining consciousness and cascading subconsciousness, with a simple form of humanly wish the surge will be sent into the spiritual corridor where positively derived spiritual encounters rule and can send a message, a very powerful message guided by 100% love and 100% light. The insurance that the spiritual world will stay pure is foreseen, if there is any possibility of corruption or miss use of this Devine power, The spiritually tuned being will subconsciously recall and return to the kingdom of Heaven until another brief encounter of true love is found by another angel and the wishful thinking is asked for the proper guidance of another again.

              Within our spiritual realm we can reach any goal and thrive on Happiness forever, unless the feeling of guilt brings you back as an angelical enchanted human with the mission to save another from despair.

              An angel is a form of rank, The true meaning of trust and pure love. Our human world is full of corruption and oddities that can shift the power of balance, Any angel returning to the human world will be faced with the thought of being corrupted and banished, or wrongfully imprisoned for what could be an eternity or until they are reached out to and saved once more.

              Speculations of Hell encourage me to write this, I believe only the corrupted part of you're soul can be banished and the purity will be extracted from you're eternal essence. The thing I believe makes you unique and personally stand out as you're own maker is you're eternal essence.

              An Eternal Essence is created or recycled, attached to a new born host and if that host is given the chance it deserves to thrive in an environment and successfully reaches the spiritual realm then a promotion is in order as your conscious and subconscious are strong enough to endure the next level.

              After a being reaches the spiritual realm for the first time, a test is in order, a test of their accumulated soul, within the essence a choice is made based on Positive and good intentions. The memory of the spiritual realm is removed from the host but not forgotten. The spiritual walkers must be certain once they give freedom of consciousness inside their spiritual realm, Each Spirit walker has been given the key into the kingdom of heaven, and is accepted into the high council where they decide if the soul was deemed worthy and if their will is strong enough to hold the weight of time itself within their mind.

              The test is full proof and consists of the usual option, of good and bad. The being that reached the spiritual realm and saw the kingdom of light for the first time is brought into the Kundalini realm, a realm that is replicated identically to their personal thoughts, abilities and unique thought patterns.

              Within their acceptance into the Kundalini realm the test is simple, its an infinite amount of possibilities, created customary by the spirit walkers based off of every thought they had, positive and negative.

              Each level of the kundalini realm is a harder choice, and to become a conscious spirit walker in the realm they must pass the infinity test of love over hate every time, because spirit walkers are the shape shifters of time they can run an infinite amount of test in a very short period of time, I know what you are thinking, infinite is unlimited so how could it ever stop? its not a matter of the test never stopping, the test only stops when the host chooses the evil choice.

              After which they *lose* and are returned to the human world, and then the human will be presented with that same choice in reality and consciousness, if they rewrite their own brain and beat their inner demon by choosing the good choice with the consequences of sacrifice they will be given the minds key into the kingdom of heaven.

              The design of this test has many angles, one of which is only felt within reality and cannot be felt in full within the kundalini realm created by the spirit walkers, they feeling is a form guilt which can manifest into any inner demon . They leave the final test of their will power to reality, where the demons run rampant and the feeling is that of 100x compared to the one in the kundalini realm.

              Only after reaching the Kundalini realm for the first time which is a direct tether into the spirit realm will the guardian angels of earth be able to initialize their ability to save you from the corruption that comes from choosing the good choice of self sacrifice. 

              a Self Sacrifice that'll set forth a chain of events in the minds eye of the subconscious bodies.

              G.V.M. is raw power, some believe Clairvoyance comes with True access into the spiritual realm where reading another mind is as simple as calculating a math problem with purely you're subconscious. 

              Spirituality is a word that defines us as a unity, its not just a way of thinking but a way of life to continue to exist.

              Spiritual Meditation is what I believe to be a direct link to the Spiritual Realm.

              its a 100% pure realm founded and sustained by love, it can never be used for hate and is monitored by our inner guiding light which is actually embedded inside you're subconscious, find the corridor of your brain that does not physically exist and you'll be accepted into the kingdom of heaven.

              Transcendental meditation is the mantra meditation of your mind.

              transcendental phrases, sounds and mantras are supposed to be secret and spoken gently within your mind, this offers you seclusion where as mantras are heard by everyone and can be distracting to some in circles. You still have the circle without the chanting and after your vocal cords are tired or chanting you can continue on the same corridor of your brain. it is also unique in mimicking sounds that you cannot repeat. Like zen meditation you do not need a lot to change your focus off of negative or derailing thought processes, its typically used in a subtle manor and someone already in a calm and relaxed state of mind, worry free and energetic. its also used to reach your inner psychological realm, and it also works wonders with trance music because you can mimic the sound effects, adjust their frequency and pitch as you go.

              Transcendental Meditation is rapidly growing, and is one of the most beneficial meditations to do on a daily basis. Certain kinds of meditation like Kundalini do not need to be used every day and Kundalini also is a psychological inducer, However like Yoga positions and postures help you stay clairvoyant, Kundalini Stretches happen by accident to some people, and are used subconsciously by some people. Kundalini is the Strongest and most realistic form of psychological meditation and it also branches out after transcendental in some cases. Kundalini stretches are designed to relieve pressure from your spinal cord which gives a certain light headedness, they can also be used to trigger a chemical in the brain known as felix that gives an instant natural numbness it also has a feeling like morphine its truly euphoric. Posture is everything in transcendental meditation, as well as many forms of meditation because if you where to contort the wrong way while driving you would instantly get a high feeling and it kicks in within the second and it has 6 layers that can be released simultaneously.

              Imagine vividly, an orchard of trees with bright golden sunset rays cascading across all the woodlands. As we bask, self enlightenment arises.
              Glowing green leafs, slightly damp bark on tree trunks glistening golden rays in the distance, warm soft grass on the toes and a steady stream, babbling water flowing and animals chirping.
              Carefully woodland critters approach as they feel out your radiant aura and see you are not a threat just a means to their warm enlightenment as well. As your aura amplifies with the subtle breeze, glowing rays of transparent color these animals begin to amplify back, giving you spiritual alignment to another layer of life.

              Didgeridoo Trance

              is when you create that steady flow with a good balance of sound and vibrations.

              After a short while the didgeridoo begins to play you as your subconscious takes over as a natural energy conservation mechanism.

              I personally have played the didgeridoo for 4 hours straight, The overall quality of my note gained a stronger cord and also required less front-pressure.

              a Smaller didgeridoo is best for beginners of zen Didging, 
              However the larger the hosts breath and thicker lips on the right mouth piece can help make loud notes very easily. By playing the didgeridoo for long amounts of time lips will go numb, after 15 minutes without playing or 1 hour of playing they will begin to expand because they are very elastic.

              The friction of the lips is based off of front back back pressure, With really strong back pressure the front pressure resists and flows backwards into the host. By using your lungs as front pressure against back pressure your compressing atoms and shaking them up rapidly causing a sort of static cling until the pressure conjoins with the object and the object conjoins with the pressure. Wind is a big bonus in the didgeridoo world, with incoming back pressure the cord becomes lightless, and the note changes to a low pitch. 

               Good suction is a big key to good didging.

               Simply by licking the lips, then press them hard around the mouth piece can cling and fill small air gaps.

              Part 2: Mathematical Visualization / Guidance
              The subconscious uses the bhaskara formula / Algebra.
              its our general tether to meditation of the body and mind. Mindful / Movement Meditation

              algebra symbolizes there is more than 1 way to move inside your own mind.

              I found that one out a few years ago.

              I've been studying many different types of meditation, after trying to figure out why the bible states the body as a temple the pieces began to make sense.

              Our universe uses the same method, known as quantum mechanics.

              The universe pushes and pulls, to accumulate matter. 

              one day after I watched an astronomy documentary about space, science and ecology. I noticed the pattern, and I drew down the pattern of how I visualized them both working.

              Then I found certain things to meditate on, while debating and studying something in the back of my mind

              a Didgeridoo is what was the bridge for me

              Once I noticed the vibrations conjoin with the atoms in the wind, I experimented.

              the bell if the bottom of the instrument

              if the bell is wider in this example say to 4.5" the back pressure becomes weaker.

              then the would be a key of A not C#

              cool right? - Leave Comments.

              Is science meditation?

              For a short answer, yes.

              Many theories in science enduce a state of meditation, pondering a new and summing up the old.

              If our universal walls look rounded like from inside a globe ( concave ).

              Do they appear convex from their outside?

              blackholes, concave and convex with polarity, a mirror only reflecks back at you on a proper angel, could a black hole distort and flip a visual around like a mirror at the exact angel?

              If a blackhole is a sphere, from both concave and convex prospectives like a hubcap appears to roll backwards could you see though the microscope of time as an equal if you are large enough?

              Could you use youre minds eye to look through a blackhole clear as a marble?

              If you move that marble back, use a magnifier and look dead in the center will it be able to show a reflection of your body in a miniature curvy form? Assuming the measurements are right, Yes..

              A clear marble holds light in, bends light around its perfect innersphere, and mirrors back.

              A prism captures and bends light, 
              A blackhole pulls in light and bends the light particles aswell.
              A blackhole eats the fire that produces light, projecting a convex.

              A blackhole is too thick and dark, deep and dense to allow us to get a light at the right angle inorder to allow convexsion on a monstrous if not god like size of an eye.

              We could possibly make something to break down the size scale. However, how would you put enough light in when it disappears in a flash.. a marble bends light from the front to the back because its perfectly round.

              Is a blackhole perfectly round?

              if a marble is positive in this equation,
              Is a a blackhole negative?

              2 convexs make a marble and appear to bubble out.

              If a black hole was 2 concaves would it bubble it in?

              like a hubcap, would it appear in an opposite manor because of how fast its spinning?

              science is the essence of mindless mindfulness.

              Any new object can be used in more than one way to trigger deep meditation this includes every layer our brain can become fused with.

              Our brains rapidly categorize and compartmentalize thoughts, substances, substance intake / output, this includes sound and every other element, physical and mental act, including social encounters, social judgement, social acceptance and many others.

              Inside a very deep trance, the trips become deeper and have more pressure the deeper into your brains core. A single corridor of your brain that intels words known as transcendental / reading can stumble into the binaural / sound corridor. Now both can be actived at the same time after the first time, but the first is what im hear to explain.

              Everytime with add 1+1 (reading)+(sound) we actually multiply, reading has many parts, such as book genre, content style, social encounters and many others like visuals brought by sight of explanitory words.

              Sound is similar, with explanitory sounds like the creek of trees in the wind, or a water fall, rain on water, rain on hard surface, rain on soft surface, rain on something hot, etc.

              My point is if you where in a deep trance the reading visuals could conjoin with the sound visuals, allowing your brain to paint a picture at 278mph. Rather than a hand at max 15mph. The brain doesnt have to go through the excess work of arms and percision, let alone patience. Thats actually why most people cant handle painting and drawing because they require an abunt amount of patience to replicate a visual, usually itll take about 278x longer than the initial designs thought.

              Modern technology as significantly reduced this and brought out higher quality with less effort.

              Patience is a virtue, with it you can handle more weight with less daily strain. A single didgeridoo note can take 5 minutes easily to reach.

              Too much front pressure and you lose the sharpness of the note, so you can actually decompress the didgeridoo while holding a note steady  in your lips like fluid in a vial and then continue to add layers that you can equalize to the front pressure to make them louder. This technique took me hours upon years to hone, the higher quality didgeridoo can help make the effort easier. Strong unconsistent wind is great, even holding the mouth piece steady while moving the bell helps dispurse the vibrations in the air that are conjoined the the didgeridoo.

              Our ripples of time balance as water.

              Timing adusts from the bottom. water disperses equally using its own traits.

              Not much of time is released, its a controlled substance like water falling from the sky.

              To understand our common senses internal clock, we must view in an external format.

              A wall clocks purpose is to tell time in that region, all human internal clocks calculate a decision right after 3.00 secon ds.

              Find when you wait exactly 3 seconds within your daily schedule and you will find your internal clock.

              Waiting includes pondering / deciphering.

              Gassy Universe

              once a week I like to do dribbling meditation because I was born ambidextrous I find a rhythm that's easily connected to,.

              By the repetitively bouncing curvature I see a glimpse, a universal form of this lightless ball as if a planet was just a hollow ball of gas within the galaxy.

              With a proper angle on a massive bounce, the ball twists in the air once it bounces again the momentum stays on a steady pace, while reversing the initial clockwise bounce.

              As I drift into this movement meditation stance I see a ball of gas flowing through a vacant galaxy compressed, cold with a gas in the bubble like aura.

              The lightless core of this behemoth is actually rotating on an axis formed by an unseen blackhole within this dark vacant galaxy.

              As this Lightless core rotates within itself another ball of gas the same weight, density and compression comes moving on a direct collision course rotating in the opposite direction.

              These 2 lightless cores are balled up into one another, without any rotation this ball of frozen gases sits still, with no movement the gas begins to accumulate rather than separate.

              As a million years passes my Frozen Core is now a massive liquid, ball of gas still sitting still... While other smaller CO2 like babies collide into this colossus, causing no friction and no substantial amount of movement.

              Within a billion years, not a spark has ignited this massive clump of fuel, no chain to this colossus reaction at 1,000 the times it was just 999 Million years ago.

              Within a trillion years the core is slowly rising its internal temperature due to its exceptional accumulation.

              This behemoth has not been pulled into its blackhole, However the Black Hole Sun is creating a strong current allowing nothing on the outside to escape and nothing to dissolve.

              This Black Hole Sun has been eating many of the CO2 Babies, nothing has filled this Black Hole Sun yet..

              as vacant time accumulates these particles, a ball of nothing but fuel is sucked into the Black Hole Sun.

              This Black Hole Sun has not been eating well, In fact its shrunken because of the Still net before it.

              This Tiny black hole eats so much, so rapidly until it pops from within as all of the gas particles clog its narrow vortex hole.

              The gas was easy to digest before, in small clumps the gas would decompress and thaw without erupting... at least within its galaxy.

              This mindless beast has been dropping particles of who knows what, where!

              Until now the small amount of gas particles where not filled with rich fluid, and as it happens not at all.

              This black hole is soaked from concave to convex in fuel, and as it finally reaches the limits of any ingestion. Conveniently right in the center of this massive fuel bubble. 

              All of the original fuel and gas that was ingested is now regurgitated right into the center of this colossus bubble.

              The blackhole did not pop the bubble, instead it released an immense amount of air pressure as it is torn apart by stability. The black hole then pops from within causing a massive explosion at the core.

              The ice cold gas mixed with the blackholes dense extracts right in the core jumpstart a massive perpetual motion like chain reaction causing this dense ball of gas not to just explode. but instead this creates a rippling effect of all of the former incoming projectiles.

              This stars birth is concentrated from within, the largest reaction imaginable occurs a ball of liquid gas had an immense amount of pressure released in the center but due to an abundance amount counter compression but nothing ignites, Everything expands evenly.

              This ball now has dense extracts rapidly rotating within its core, causing microscopic metallic particles 'released from the dense black hole' to accumulate, positive to negative.

              As this magnetic particle continues motion all are separated from its host.

              Another trillion years passes after the black hole sun collision, the current inside these magnets is reaching the outer layer of the earth due to a light pulse charges nothing has erupted still.

              Even the black hole got stuck in a ball of sticky goo.

              over the past trillion years more gas and dense particles have accumulated causing a shell of hardened crust, with rich fuel being purified due to a steady mixing like motion. This purification process removes the helium atom from the carbonated oxygen atoms. while the dense fuel accumulates and concentrates all on its own.

              Finally, Light! far across the galaxy a small ball of burning rock is set to collide. 

              After the collision, the fuse was not long enough. The rich breathable air and moisture on the outer layer help protect the core.

              As the planet sits virtually motionless still, a black hole begins to pull this encrusted fuel bubble into a momentum.

              The magnetic field begins to draw in more metals.

              Across the galaxy on the opposite side of this black hole a star has been successfully born.

              pulled into a rotation after 20 million years light begins to spread heat, and the core of this planet is extremely thick and fuel locked away in pockets where friction has allowed reformation without combustion.

              the new star is set to cross paths with this new planet, once they do their magnetic fields are equally balanced, the force of this new planet draws the new star in closer and reverses the polarity until on a balanced course of the stars immense heat to gently draw it in and repel with solar magnetic radiation.

              a billion years passes and there is life dwelling beneath the surface of this crust, in water that accumulated over time.

              This life is just a festering bowl of germs and over time will begin to rapidly accumulate, accept a massive meteor is in a collision course for earth, The meteor gains speed on top of its momentum from when it was just a projectile, just barely blasting by the sun where it would've been incinerated crashing into earth.

              As the crust cracks fluid begins to ignite rapidly, the entire top layer ignites a a matter of moments releasing tons of force, pushing the sun back to a safe distance, the fallout from this explosion rain down for thousands of years. The explosion itself pushed earths ozone out and removed an abundant amount of fuel with fire.

              Underneath that layer is more fuel, while rain gets a jump start in the lesson of evaporation the earth still rotates the sun along with other planets with similar magnetic fields that resist attraction to earths  magnetic field.

              the fire burns fast as it was light due to the filtration / purification process, and the core is ignited from within its own shell, rippling heat from within the atmosphere the magnetic field is fully charged and in a stronger state than before due to heat allowing the magnets to resist each other less.

              After a few billion years life is flourishing, many new genetic makeups of germs have accumulated, allowing new and unique design of creatures to adapt within their environment and grow around it through life cycles.

              after the previous explosion, all the top layer of rocks where blasted into powder, creating dirt, sand, powdered salt crystals.

              allowing nutrients to break down inside a new climate while more crash into the surface.

              Finally earths eco system is born as my basket ball stops spinning and I come back to reality.

              Like a clean canvas my possibilities are endless and once that master piece is Finished. I'll help guide our new generation through the lucid minds' of millions, Where they too will help discover all that is unknown.

              I see technology as an infinite, quantum mechanics are dependent upon new technology evolving rapidly. Inspiration + Guidance is as vast as a single black hole.

              When lucid minds converge, we release immense power as we cascade.
              Blackholes' Cataclysm into the eons.
              Thus one white hole is born and funnels from our universe releasing the conjoined efforts of billions of black holes. Trillions of Compounding equations resulting in an inevitable algorithm that is followed with endless opportunities spread throughout time.

             Jades in Jungles Overview
            </button>
            <p>
              When I was younger and in my mid teens I had no idea what I was doing, but it stopped my body aches, woke me up but also calmed down my agitated nervous system. I didn’t even think twice of doing it, meaning it was completely subconscious and I had to stop that because at one point I stretched too soon so I thought i messed up ( this is when my consciousness caught on ) and I felt pain I’ve never felt before, you see what happens you get hurt is your brain sends a electro signal and with that signal reaching the target it notices a lot of pain, so before you feel pain you feel numbness you subconscious goes in 3 steps
               1: electro signal to the brain
              2: calibrates the pain based on the frequency of the signal
              3: releases felix. 

              this is so you do not feel the signal of your nerve basically being crushed to the 10/10 phase, if you are a kid, not being guided who found about this around the age of 12 but never consciously studied it, or even paid attention to it in full it can have really bad side effects, the whole concept is relatively new, Kundalini syndrome is still not being taken seriously as it should, especially in children because releasing felix in your sleep from jerking in a nightmare will really confuse your brain, everything in your dream feels real, looks real, sounds real, taste real, so releasing an extremely powerful numbing agent into your body while asleep can cause permanent psychological damage and in some cases worse symptoms if you happen to be ill at the time, like muscle spasms, the inability to control your heart rate for hours after an episode, psychological flashbacks of horrific dreams that felt real and in some cases you can self induce yourself with Dark Kundalini out of curiosity.

              There is Light Kundalini and its magical, a world crafted by your subconscious and never before seen by you, but some how made by you for you. From the taste of a once in a life time sandwich, to a magical city at your disposal everything in your brain is thought to be real.

               Only in dark kundalini have I ever been able to reach a lucid state in which I could reassure myself it was not real, even though in a psychological realm that only goes so far and feeling your heart rate go up does not help. I managed to leave bread crumbs of a sort that would let me stop it when it happened again and only in a self induced state. this only worked once and I saw my grandmas ghost before she died, I had to scream at a wall to wake myself I screamed wake up!, nothing happened second time was louder WAKE UP, still was not awake and by the third time I screamed and flexed every muscle I felt control of and like a vampire rises up out of a bed I jolted straight up still thinking I was in the psychological realm. I was unable to stop my heart from racing and I Could practically feel it beating of its chest for a few hours, after which I felt truly alive its hard to explain but I think that was the moment I broke my mind from entering the dark kundalini realm because I found out that it would happen when I was very angry and forced to goto bed early or possibly other causes, as I got older I found out a skin infection I had of mold might have been part of the cause because it was dehydrating me for a while and my doctor at the time misdiagnosed it so it got worse.

              My first Dark Kundalini experience I believe was around 10 and I had some really bad news previously, the kind your brain tries to block out as a kid as a defense mechanism. What happened was I felt like i was sitting, in a solid black room but with no visible walls, for a little while I felt comfortable and safe, and at ease, somewhere down the line I wanted to get out and I guess my internal clock was not developed yet but I must have been in there a long time, because I would scream to be let out and I would see the ripples of my voice be carried and I wouldn’t hear it, then shortly after I would hear my voice from behind me. Unable to even see myself for I guess hours I finally woke up and blocked it out for nearly 10 years, the reason I think it was kundalini is because I remember meditating in my dream and thinking clearly, although its been so long now I don’t know what I was thinking or how clear the thought process was, but one thing is for sure I remember the first time I meditated and how great that felt and thats how I remember that scenario starting.

              you see dreams move by really fast and they dissipate your brain picks up on that and thats good, In Dark Kundalini everything seems precise down to the time it takes to walk to the next room from your bed that you slept in and “woke up in the dream” I self diagnosed myself with Kundalini syndrome I ran across it while just reading about weird forms of meditation and then I had a flashback of dozens of kundalini dreams from good and bad.

              I found if I tensed my facial muscles and thought dark thoughts until i dazed out I would end up there, So I did on purpose a few times and one of my last times was when I tried to break the ties about how I felt by reliving a Dark Kundalini Trip, thats when my body started almost a glitch to where my heart and mind, lungs even my legs where not controlled, after that I felt great and never had wanted to go back and since I knew exactly how it happens I just make 100% sure I get out of a negative state of mind. However it did reoccur once on vacation, There was this doll and it was floating a few feet up and was a few feet big, it was all dark accept for the beige doll with no face or even body structure in a barely visible doorframe, I started to try and voodoo the thing, I tried to contort and bend it in a lucid state but I couldn’t see my hands but I could feel the doll and it just would not contort I got frustrated really fast must’ve been no more than a few minutes in real life time, as I tried to squeeze the life out of the thing with all my might the room around me and just the visual of the doll started to crush almost like if it was being shrunk by a black hole, I could see a glimpse of something though the doll or the black hole like thing, I’m not sure what I was seeing but a force made me stop squeezing out of fear of the unknown i suppose because it felt like I was about to be warped into the next phase like kundalini likes to do and I woke up and practically slung myself up. 


              I really want to be able to go on light kundalini trips at free will, but even thinking back explaining everything the best I can has a negative effect on me.

              As these roots intertwine, gaining depth in our earths crust, a notation of my inner-most mindful thoughts Emerges from beneath the surface and into the clouds.

              Nerves grown in bone as my trees core converges a sweet subtle balance between land and
               air.

              Whilst Veins Grown around as Vine through Jungles surrounded by colorful jades.
              My trees rough bodily exterior keeps, Holds, Moulds the growth of my trees crown.


              As my mind flourishes by the wind, the stiff inner branches stretch with bright green leaves to grasps the suns nutritional warmth without the relentless heat. 

              As my roots split paths, so do my branches grabbing multiple families of unique species as a stored thought perched high in the minds eye.

             Keen Kindness Overview
            </button>
            <p>
              Passing down good energy to people is exhausting of resources, someone who is kind to everyone has a large burden, when you do a kind favor for a despicable person, and they continue to pass down negative energy by harnessing others positive energy is the very evolution of chaos.

              Finding the right people to be kind to is keen in passing down as much positive influence possible. Being judgmental is the wrong way to go about this, an aura analysis with heightened senses that’ll warn you if the person you are charismatically engaged with is putting off negative electro-magnetic vibrations. A shift in universal laws of attraction is all you must look for, rather than just focusing consciously on their body language, subconsciously take in their body, mind and unique frequency, a calm frequency will keep you calm, an agitated frequency does not entirely mean its reflecting around you as its target, use the force of potent positive energy to engage with them on their level and chisel away the tension.

              Negative energy is hard to pick up on if you are in a negative state of mind, you’ll feel more welcomed to it and pass you by of their negative intentions.
              The same rule goes for positive energy, Accept one crucial key, Positive multiples upwards with other positive elements. Negative multiplied by negative depletes energy reserves.

              Positive engaged by Negative is drained of chi,
              Negative engaged by Positive works like a dry sponge on a wet surface, it’ll greedily sap the energy out of you, wether mental physical possessions.

              Slight negative pulses does not mean the person is corrupt, targeting you or desperate. However their subconscious will begin to cling and draw energy from you that’ll only enable their  acceptance to negative realms.

             Lucid Levitation Overview
            </button>
            <p>
              Guided visual meditation is closer to lucid dreaming than just guided meditation, When you lucid dream you are right in the middle of sleep and alertness. This is hard to do and happens easier in the subconscious state because our subconscious has a more accurate sense of time within itself.

              Guided Visual Meditation is created in your subconscious within a lucid state, but instead of you blocking your surroundings to conserve energy you have enough spare to move from Lucid dreaming to guided meditation which is then added together and pre formatted in one lucid thought, Its your subconscious way of being patient while the master piece is thought up.

              Once your subconscious knows what it wants its watching every calculation and cross checking it as it decides to make 100% sure it does the job properly. Imagine Guided meditation, you are following a path that you do not seem to recognize, Guided visual meditation recognizes the path but quickly generates the next unique step that you do not see coming, you can be in multiple worlds at the same time, walking through pictures you mind painted with 3D architecture in moments and each step forward takes a millisecond and it works faster than your consciousness so yes your consciousness will remember the journey and yes it even gave your subconscious the information to work with, but it does not play the part of visualization.

              G.V.M. is raw power, some believe Clairvoyance comes with True access into the spiritual realm where reading another mind is as simple as calculating a math problem with purely you're subconscious. 

              Spirituality is a word that defines us as a unity, its not just a way of thinking but a way of life to continue to exist.

             Mellow Mantra Overview
            </button>
            <p>
              A mantra is a word, phrase, syllable or moment when you speak out loud to yourself or to others.

              Mantras are Known for being used by monks, they help guide their own subconscious by hearing their own speech, as well as hearing their fellow monks whom they adore and feel protected by. The human mind is really complicated and many things are disproved or are just not provable unless to ourself. Monks have a unity that protects them from fear of themselves that resides in the unknown of their body and the unknown of the world around them. They surround themselves with love and cherishes of one another, they hear themselves chant with one another and in that instance they hear every other monks chant inside their own giving them the will, courage, dedication and enjoyment of a lifestyle around the deepest forms of meditation.

              A chant is chanted by one monk and heard by them all, they do not try to best the other ones chant but instead add to it and purify as their vocal patterns change from being immensely crafted by their own and inspired by another over a lifetime. A chant is Powerful they reach into the deepest portion of your soul and the other souls surrounding you, Guided by a divine light it starts as an uncertainty and sometimes awkward process, but after being altered by surrounding   beings and your inner peace it continues to grow into a unique sound aura that brings many of other beings up by inspiring them with the sound of angels flowing through you and echoing through the heavens and calling them down for a moment of pure peace that’ll last a lifetime within the garden of eden as it takes both good and bad to grow.

              Sound waves bounce off each other, as well as merge with one another, sometimes chants get off rhythm and are not that heavenly sound you once heard. This is because the waves of sound are not colliding at the right pace and are not of the right frequency to merge. Chanting is a unity of sound colliding Mimicking someones chant is not thievery but acceptance of being one and the raw essence of combined beauty at its primal form, which to some the off beat is the best beat and the uniquely unbalanced essence of inexperience is perfect in its own light.

              When chants collide its not just sound releasing itself, its Adam and Eve being reunited through the sanctity of life being acknowledged as one. Chanting and Mantras require a different skill set that we all have, but may not use. When someone chants with say one other person they lose track of their own voice, but they know if they keep it steady and in a timed rhythm all will be heard, someones voice may be louder and they cannot hear themselves think or speak, but they still feel it as the vibrant sound ripples through their body and their mind perceives it as anew. Some would say the odd one out is the lucky one in a brief moment that was not planned.

              The unexpected has been known to allow minds to thrive and feel inspired once more to meditate even unknowingly.
              heres an example: 

              Once I was in a restaurant, feeling quite spiritual waiting as the packed panda expresses line slowly moved up awaiting my family to place the order, as I sat patiently and hungry the noisy but soothing sound collisions of what seemed like a hundred people echoing off the small walls, glass, metal and sound waves spoke to me, I started to hear a clear voice that I do not know what was being said, and it was not of one vocal note it was crafted of many different cords and I could hear it clear as day and was the only thing my focus was being drawn too, I could not make out what I was being told or what presence I was being graced with, and in that moment I began to visualize all the different octaves in a sound driven visual pattern that was colorful beyond my wildest dreams. That is when I realized each chant has its own octave element like each color of paint has its own  colorful element. Now I find myself using that one of a kind guiding chant in transcendental meditation because I have not been able to replicate the octave rainbow I’ve only had the grace of hearing once. when I find myself reminiscing I still feel the moment as if I was drifting through time, I feel like a spirit was in the room using the vocal cords of many to send me a feeling through my subconscious, maybe it was a coincidence, but out of every room that has been packed and loud that I have spaced out in this has never happened, Although I still try to space out within a room of busy souls expressing joyful emotions and conjuring an energetic storm for our spiritually guided angels to be drawn to.


              Monks use vocal mantras to notice every surge of energy that comes into par, and I believe they use unique form of identifying a uniquely you surge to the host.

              Then when their mantra is heard simultaneously they adapt like a dog can smell only up close but rely on sight to confirm in a distance.

              When these 2 unique forms merge overtime the surge they pick up from their fellow monks aura and mantra follows in sync within their own, but only when they do so on par with one another will it have the desired result of being fueled by another humans electric surge.

              The mantra is a time sync, since we cannot state the millisecond the surge is on, the mantra will coagulate automatically with your unique surge once you reach the subconscious realm.

              this is a natural conservation method of the human mind and body, it is used to pump the blood in a heart beat and when the heart beat is over the energy signal is released to allow the heart to pump.

              You could say that the heart beat of monks are in tune with one another, that is if they have had enough time to fully adapt, Because each beat of the heart can adjust by what is close to 0.01 of a millisecond at a time, so in order for them to fully sync it could take a billion heart beats.

              In some cases if they are closer to one another's natural rhythm you could fully sync within a hundred thousand heart beats.

             Number Nine Overview
            </button>

            <p>
              Reflection on our choices leads to greater scenarios, The first time we make a choice inside a corridor we have to real control over the environment.

              Second time we come across the same scenario, we are a little more prepared. Not knowing if we made the right choice the first time, we willingly open up that second door in hopes all the problems are awaiting our arrival behind it. Rarely is this the case, in actuality the first door was what our gut told us to go with. From passed down traits from generations upon generations our subconscious has an interface precompiled to our existence.

              Third time we go back into door number one, and the second choice we will alter, however this isn’t giving the perfect results we presume exist.

              Fourth time we continue in door one, alter the second choice and make it a little farther. However the goal is still far in the distance and we are naturally weary because anxiety starts on the third repetitive action, causing us to over think and dig back farther into our brains, this is a good thing yet in small increments. When in reality, that threshold is yet to be established to our bodily limits.

              Fifth time brings out courage, as the weak willed, feeble minded ones have been filtered out in worries of disappointment, eventually they will come back. Until then we persevere first, which leads us to the sixth attempt in hopes this is the final one, if you are the lucky one, depending on the scenario this could be it, or just one doorway from being the finalizer.

              Seventh time, depending on the persons willingness as this point requires greater endurance, usually obtained from prior roads traveled. Acceptance that number eight is just right around the corner is a self preservation algorithm, because of all these ups and downs for the typical human mind real psychological impact both positive and negative have emerged, the key is to keep them separated, the first time around this level is likely to have them merge, immediate reflection on all of your positive experiences that you’ve gained from, and knowledge buried deep within the negative realm should be intertwined without awakening the negative course of thought processes.

              Number Nine is typically that threshold, right before the double digits occur. The universe has secretly sent you down the right path from the first attempt to build up your abilities, because once you open this doorway, everything you expected is there yet embedded with all of the other elements at work. Now that you see your goal, you’ve got to continue the trek, as the final test you see all your heart desires, and you’ve still got your work cut out for you to organize, rationalize and initiate a final plan while the door is open and you are in the doorway. 

              A rapid selection of choices is in order, you are on the spot just as stage one your gut says one thing and your mind says the other. One piece of information stands out, your subconscious is aware of it and your conscious mind is flustered, and has a swell of negative chemicals assembling a blockade against the correct and positive choice.

              You might be on the spot, however reflective meditation harnesses time restraints and utilizes our perception of time. By drastically calculating at speeds propelled by riding the waves of energy traveling at the speed of light.

              An hour of contemplation and alignment feels as if it passes, your reflective reserves are depleted. The answer is clear, body aligns with mind, subconscious guides the conscious, and without any regret you make a once in a lifetime choice and you successfully align with inner purpose.

             Own my Omen Overview
            </button>
            <p>
              Human subconsciousness is an endless flow, rather stopping the current to try and control it, adjust the flow by adding to the top of the stream. Read, feel, and obtain this omen of mine.

              All forms of meditation inspire, touch and even coagulate other forms of meditations.

              Hybrid Meditation is when you adapt from one genre to another, releasing the dam of carefully chemically crafted cognitive emotions, Eventually the acidic nature of all metabolizing chemicals will dissolve our natural restriction barrier releasing a wave of new emotions colliding with other chemically altered balances of embodied emotions.

              Hybrid Meditation Exists by our universal Algorithm known as accumulation.

              Imagery and visual meditation has been proven to alleviate pain, speed up healing and combat stress, anxiety and other forms of tension. It is acknowledged as an extremely effective healing technique worldwide, having been long overlooked by practitioners of western medicine. Visual meditation works well for people who find it more difficult to focus on a mantra or a particular topic. Though not always curative, by practicing imagery or visual meditation it has been proven that 90% of the ailments people go to see their doctor over can be relieved drastically. Imagery is the most fundamental language we have as everything we do is processed through the mind and stored as an image even if it is sound it’ll be stored as sound and an image this is why writing music is important as anything else. This image which can then be transferred into speech, writing, engineering and etc. Because it’ll correlate with sound, the memory will be that much more precise.

             Polar Purge Overview
            </button>
            <p>
              Contemplative Meditation :

              I've studied many Religions, Meditation Styles and common Scientific Experiments. Algebra is the Deciphering Element. A true purge in polarity, one set to align all with their unique inner light.

              Christianity has rules and powerful enlightening guidance but I have yet to find one religion I can dedicate myself to. Temple, Church, Mosque all have Prayer in common, They offer the feelings of Peace, Safety, Tranquility and General Meditation as well as many other aspects.

              But I meditate fine without undeniable faith of one specific fate.

              I find pondering about Different Religious standpoints to trigger Contemplative Meditation. 

              I believe anyone who acknowledges the possibility of a higher power is right, However I feel as if I know the energy that is generated by man and accumulated within our universe does not belong to a single higher power.

              I believe every human is that higher power and the Guidance we individually receive if result of proper alignment of concentrated minds. 

              I believe everything has a creator, I believe the creator of our universe added elements to monitor their collisions for the purpose of uninterrupted scientific experiments. I also believe the experiments developed 
          </div>
        </div>by man are all unique and documented by our Spiritually connected higher power.

              I believe the universe is the creation of a higher power such as *God*. However when we pray and receive undeniable proof of the true effects of repentance we *7 Billion* as a whole give a tiny fragment of negatively charged atoms to create a single positively charged atom.

              How can one religion state its the only religion?

              Religion has been a tool of mankind for greater good, in some cases the corrupt use religion to exploit people. I personally have nothing against any other religion, Because every religion offers its own unique way of tethering the host to all cosmic elements. Which allows a stronger, healthier society.

              I know there is no positive without a negative, once all negatives a converted through human filter of thought we will all be brought into the spiritual realm only after humans perception of time has stood still for trillions of years in a galactic trance.

             Quantum Quake Overview
            </button>
            <p>
              Movement meditation is explained as being similar to mantra meditation or transcendental meditation, heartbeat meditation and Zen / instrumental meditation, latihan and yoga. Some say there is not a big difference between many types of meditation and that there are many names for one kind usually they are right but sometimes people mess up and label a meditation as one style when some cultures use it  to explain the combination of multiple styles in one.

              Movement Meditation is when you gently move while you relax and focus on that motion until you fall into the desired daze.
              Movement Meditation helps with extra energy, and is good for someone who fidgets a lot.
              It has an effect on your body and mind that allows you to trance out, I prefer movement meditation while listening to psychedelic trance music because I like to come to consciousness every 5-10 minutes until I find the imagery I’ve been looking for, for a painting or drawing.

              Movement meditation seems to be harder for me personally to stay locked into a meditative state of mind, Mantras and Chants take longer for me to be induced but they last longer once I am. Movement Meditation can be done sitting or standing, its also easily combinable with heartbeat meditation on intermissions ( incase your arms get tired )

              Swaying is easy while sitting down, even rocking chairs help you keep moving. Sometimes if you have been sick with the flu or something that is dreaded movement meditation is helpful and gentle on your mind, When you are sick your body is already over-worked and just laying down in a bed not sleeping but not moving is harmful because your blood flow goes down. Things like visuals and sound even focusing cause bad side effects like nausea or headaches. Movement meditation is hard when you are sick because your body is exhausted the entire time. But it does however count as exercise which is good for you when you are ill, and best of all if you manage to get locked in you get the exercise continuously without feeling it.

              Being unaware of an Earth Quake while in a meditative state could have intense effects.

             Relaxing Rhythm Overview
            </button>
            <p>
              Guided meditation is relevant to Lucid dreaming, guided meditation is easier after you’ve been lucid dreaming for a while, I say this because meditation is one step above sleep / dreaming.

              In lucid dreaming you create what you want as you are dreaming, there is no layer of your subconscious that’ll create something beforehand to guide you.

              Guided meditation is almost like your brain having a cheat sheet or a set path to follow that your brain took only a moment to come up with, Its not something that comes with consciousness, but instead created by your deep subconscious and then replicated as you enter the proper state of mind.

              The name Guided is miss leading I feel like it says you’ll be guided and it will work every time, but thats not the case, The human subconscious has a mind of its own. While you are thinking about what drink will go with your robust sandwich and if it will if you a stomach ache, its working hard pumping your blood. But most relevant to this conversation its thinking about everything that comes to mind, from what you see, hear, smell, and taste and even consciously visualize in your mind. Its occurred to me that its possible for our mind to overlay itself because its blind to us and we are born blind to it.  Is it logically correct that your subconscious opened up the taste corridor at random and you where consciously eating? if so it could have effects that distort one another because one is formed of mainly positive energy and the other is its opposite positive+.

              Guided meditation is a high form of meditation it requires subconscious focus, Zen / Deep relaxation, because you subconscious is whats guiding your subconscious, I  believe the reason consciousness does not correspond perfectly with subconscious to begin with is because they repel one another. Have you ever had the bizarre experience of forgetting something as you thought it? Thats because it was stored in your subconscious and as soon as your consciousness got close to it and charge and pushed the trace of the saved moment somewhere else.

              Its easy for us to remember something our conscious recognized because when our conscious goes back to it they attract rather than repel one another.

              Its easy for our subconscious to remember something stored in its subconscious because they too attract to one another, Guided meditation is about your subconscious being strong enough to guide itself.

             Sunshade Sensei Overview
            </button>
            <p>
              Part1: Time is its own substance
              Part2: Growth Ritual 
              Part3: Physiological origin of time

              Part 1:
              Within an endless vortex of matter, Time emerges allowing conscious beings to adapt to a new body while developing new senses.

              Our bodies have grown around earths environment because of an eternal clock that initially developed static senses.

              The Earths’ Sun uniquely doesn’t burn everything alive on each rotation, we Instead conjoin with other matter unavoidably.

              As each of our own unique bodies begin to accumulate mass we also begin to accumulate buoyancy.

              Buoyancy of a spirit using our earths static field as a conductor of man has created vastly unique ecological occurrences.

              What if time is an empty vessel that created an existence with itself?

              How can we be sure of anything without enough exploration,
               Man is not shark of water.
               Man is Spirit of Time.


              Part 2:
              Within our existence microscopic organisms live within all biological and ecological substances, --man too accumulates, within a larger substance feeding on the vessel surrounding.

              Accept with conscious thought we can decide our own balances by concentrating focus on specific bodily intakes that are cross referenced with results by allowing faster blood flow, Larger muscle capacitors in the body and brain and Harder shells around sockets such as bone and cartilage.

              Growth is a push from below our crust from the core that is conjoined with the suns push of radioactive solar flares.

              A heart restarts with a strong pulse, essentially the core of both sun, earth and moon create a trifecta of life that has expanded by a constant agitation on settling substances.

              Part 3: 
              Society does not dictate time, only orchestrates the outcome of vibrant patterns.
              Time is a manmade scientific explanation, Although without the proper balance of sun rise to set jungles and every other Zen and Green eater could not emerge. However time can fluctuate so can the adapting life. So theoretically the science we have discovered and labeled our Global time is much like a co-ordinate on a map, a path to follow when the leaders whereabouts are unknown.

              With the conscious concept of time society can preserve life by calculating birth cycles.
              Our universe was born and though we cannot calculate exactly when, we can get a good estimate of how much time could be left in our region.

              our steady spiral of time calculates when another inhabitable dimension might open up, and with proper increments “Time Travel” is explained as leaving a building before an explosion is set to go off. So rather than warping somewhere on this earth magically we could possibly open a portal though the universes element slide of matter a white hole is potentially harmless because its the opposite of a blackhole which sucks in matter per second based on its dimensions. A white hole is similar, its most likely not a straw using pressure to pull up, but the gentle slide down.

              All outer space is cold for a reason, its the casing that holds us together, similar to muscle on bone. In a few trillion years our galaxy could be emptied such as a drink being sucked dry from countless blackholes. However all of these blackholes likely funneled those substances somewhere in a compressed state of element known as dark matter. Dark matter is what holds the seems of everything together, Dark-matter is extremely dense and like extremely cold dense substances they expand with heat and low pressure. If a white-hole was a billion miles long, traveling without any force based on the circumference of our universe we could say traveling a million miles an hour would have as much back pressure as a 5 mile gust of wind.

              This dark matter is much like a flat batter, after 45 million miles it begins to expand.
              After 250 million miles the nuts begin to emerge, after 750 million miles the moisture is all almost gone, and by 1 billion miles the end of the line where thousands of other ovens are mass producing dark matter muffins accept its not one kind of muffin, its every element all being dumped into a universe with one massive black hole causing cosmic collisions crossing meteors causing friction and eventually combustion, all of which could be avoided while we cultivate a new universe.

             Thickening Transcendence Overview
            </button>
            <p>
              Grappling throughout our earths core, is our mindfield.


              Leaving a trembling shake in its wake,
              the barrier that forged our fates and protected us with a divine shield that is unseen by any eye. 
              our earths skeleton is much like the human eye.
              A thin invisible layer of magnitud swaying,
              that mixes in its perpetual spherical bowl.

              from the outside a liquid layer is seen,
              from the inside an invisible layer is felt.

              and another invisible one mimics its motions unseen, one is in one is out, just as veins.

              We see with both dark and light correlating together in a flowing mellow meadow of harmonious evolutions.


              Why do we have two eyes, 
              One is in one is out, however each syncs to both positive and negative simultaneously,
              by following the opposing frequencies and flowing upwards resisting a tide of energy,
              A vision is projected and inverted.

              After a vision is perceived, each experience leaves its mark in a trail of reminants.


              is it just a coincident or is the universe leaving clues that even it may not be aware of? 
              To me, after awakening in the opposing eye is the state of trance and cognitive alignment to the spiritual realm.
              In which we are blossoming here to obtain the right stature for acceptance into our heavenly depiction of existence.


              The clue I speak of is the second eye, maybe the earth wants a sibling to help remove the absurd amount of negative continuums it accidentally drops into participation with.

              If we are alive in this world, Alive in a spiritual realm then we have two eyes when conjoined create the paradox of purgatory within our mind, 

              unless we break the state of rhythm we are held so tightly entwined to.
              This paradox is known as the third eye, Contorted by deities and aligned by premonition contrived with weighty times.
              Sometimes we acknowledge the gut feeling that we will be injured or derailed from the trails we have worked desperately to settle in.

              Sometimes its just another feeling of which is triggered by fear, we must conquer our fears. However attempting to conquer primal fears and modern ones proves difficult whilst risky.
              Inorder to thrive we must conquer the bad, to align with the good otherwise our existence is non existent in the eyes of our beholder.

              Imagine a snow-globe, really hold the thought of the snow on the ground around the village and people, shake it up and calm down to the enjoyment of the snow falling slowly.
              Now imagine the same snow globe, this time without the snow. This is a village of people with no purpose of the globe excluding the snow as well.

              When we fail to explore the depths of the elements in full or at least try our best to form a hypothesis to ponder upon for our lifetime that will baffle ourselves we use the precious resource known to deities as the sands of time.

              Just as all our resources require effort to find the location of, harvest and then process.

              So do the deities, this is the common tether of alikeness that allows deity to guide man through their gaze of reflective organic globes.

              This isn’t permanent nor painful it is liberating and unknown.

              Both eyes conjoin to create center mass in which the third eye is invented and similar to a signal-homing beacon.
              Without the dark, we cannot see into the world and the makers of the world cannot see into us, water is the original mirror in which man mirrors the surrounding traits.

              We are hosted in real time, and with the right algorithm we foresee logical outcomes based upon our past experiences and witnessing another results.

              All of our brains, auras and thought processes combined probably wouldn’t match the precision of a single deities notion intellectual supervision.

              Our perception is limited and missing many puzzle pieces, each divine deity holds their own unique piece and when they are all united as one a 4D portrayal emerges However the time these deities spend on earth wasn’t enough to perform their perfect combination.

              Why would they put the effort in? Maybe its a combination of boredom, desire, curiosity and binding fates.
              Alchemy isn’t just a precise balance of chemicals, it is the precise time of precise chemicals in the precise environment.

              What if they obtained undoubtable knowledge leading to the hypothesis of we create our own heaven, just as we construct our own residence?

              We hold another beings time table in our hands whenever we are set to cross paths, the future isn't yet defined nor written in stone, we must proceed onwards for what is likely an eternity or close to the seal all fates.

             Usual Underdog Overview
            </button>
            <p>
              Being humble, tranquil, peaceful and kind are all reasons why a monk makes a usual underdog, judgement, and assumptions allow great opportunities for one to arise. 

              We do not start trouble, eventually that trouble will come forth and all harnessed energy concentrates into one moment. A reflective forge of time, awakens the tether of mindful humans.

              Routine is important and healthy, as long as it is not entitled to a negative entity.
              Anger in routine is bad for body, mind and elemental synchronicity. 

              Rage triggers adrenaline, a chemical agent that slows down perception of time. With other side effects as well. The more it is used, the weaker its potency by building up tolerances.

              This effect also leads to dangerous presumptions in order to thrive forward and get ahead of the curve.

              Masterful monks slow down the perception of time on an entirely different accord, and when virtue mixes with rage all negative side effects are extracted out, their perception of time amplifies down, and down. Though seen to be moving at our sync of time, a mind full of magnitude rides the surges, the faster their body moves, thought begins to acquire a larger wave to ride. every calculation, perfected before consciousness initiates the action. Some say a monks subconscious is so unbelievably aligned with their conscious that their conscious has its own layer of consciousness, one of which harnesses the subconscious trait of analyzing in the background. Many would argue this is just another layer of subconsciousness obtained. However the main level of consciousness is in control of both layers. So, while warding off a foe,  and staying focused and non repetitive with conscious thought, the same aspect of consciousness is taking everything into count, doing a final cross check just as the subconscious does, yet this conscious mind is reviewing, inserting and initiating actions faster than the body can pump out, resulting in a magnetic balance pulling their bodies to a greater momentum.

              From Body to Light.
              Part 1: Soul Tether
              Part 2: Rebirth
              Part 3: Result of our higher Time Accumulator

              _____
              Part 1:

              As I pass through the cold dark endless oblivions' wake I sense what can only be the seem of my fate of light guaranteed to reach its destination.
              A star, Reaches Far and wide as a Signal Beacon it'll not be missed on the darkest of nights.
              Universe, oh,.? Universe is just another mirror parallel mirror around us all, using both light and dark to cast our inner essence back at us.
              We see in another Concave and Convex format allowing optimal focus, as Flesh and Bone we are science in the raw consciousness is the window through the mirror gazing on us with just another scientific Equation in mind.
              Our universe is 1 marble in a bag of Different chemical alterations of consecutive time. Earth is our Pinnacle of Consciousness Created with a new concoction each and every marble is touching, rubbing across one another ever.
              Yet our clearest inner Auras allow the Holder to separate us by a specific color is seen in a 3rd dimension Chemical Clouds dispersed over generations yet frozen amongst other forms of Toxic Concoctions in an enclosed environment.
              as the frozen aura of our evolutionary current is melted by vibrant inner auras blossoming from another nebula, a whole other universe can be entered.
              Another balance to our ecological requisition intake of time.
              Conjoined as sphere on sphere, melted matter rifts a subtle seem as vibrations reduce pressure particles begin to settle just as an icicle is formed.
              A portal with no resistance of pressure,
              an invisible funnel guiding the flow of remnants.
              Sands in the hour glass of time, Unseen by a reflection of light off dark, Clear makes the 3rd dimensional characteristics form. The White of our eyes wraps our dark pupils as one, almost as if 2 universes conjoined to form one host.
              As I flow fluently through the cold waterless current without a body to feel, I still can sense the Pressure of cold around my souls beacon of light, an encasing current carrying me down into our black souls stream.
              ohh, what a gentle feeling of a trillion year spa calmly crawls down with a vacant transcendent being formed beneath another surface waiting to emerge as my consciousness light burns from within I breathe off continuous motion of passive accumulation and soul concentration. My every creative thought is passed with only an inner visual of weightless time formed for eons of hold / cold meditation creating sub-live in every unique form. a Crust to hold a reptiles cold blood in with warmth allowing survival in damp dark region.
              My crust is a surge so vast, soul compression allows me to pulse straight through a nebulas sun as my bloods 278 mph current was the kick to start a larger biological mechanism.
              Faster than a cataclysm my Speed is amped from just one of our polar universes my back pressure of repulsion conjoined to a Surging chain reaction of magnetical-attraction.
              Without a body my internal clock is fried, with every second sensed through tempered layers is another billion years in the perception of my old human mind.
              Part 2:
              _____
              Removal of those unseen shackles, Inspires my new body to accumulate within a genetical pool of my own inner-magnetism of pre-developed subconsciousness.
              Creativity has returned to me, only slightly without sight, scent, touch or algebraic algorithms.
              If I have no developed senses what is my inner creativity drawn too..
              Another surge, another dark corridor. Accept I feel somethings essence in the form nothing, recognizable.. *At least you are there* I hear as my brain begins to form, finally layers of time accumulated a corridor, my sound is based off of surges of magnetism derived from other subconscious substances.
              The voice was to be of my own, as if I was speaking to myself.
              With all the essence of my soul in a confined inner ecosystem, I have yet to disperse my genetic abilities for our initial emerge.
              Somehow I remember everything as it was before only in the form of a substance, Any brain uses unique substances and algorithms to store relevant information conveniently.
              Those senses where developed over time each formed from one another until microscopic consciousnesses conjoined for ecologically dictated evolutionary attributes. as my essence festers my residue is reduced and mixed with an unknown amount of diversified DNA developed attributes.
              As a form of electric bacteria the heat of an inner crust seeps inwards my soul begins to absorb more particles as these electrons cause rapid accumulation.
              Instead of feeling one inner voice, I feel hundreds a second and they inspire and drive my only source subconscious acceptance.
              Part 3:
              _____
              I've defined my life to only myself it seems, all through past experiences, in this state I have 278x and the potential of an even higher grade of thought processor and cognitive capacitor.
              Without my internal clock my Cerebral Balance is non-existent and my thoughts are spinning too fast, a trillion thoughts inside one no difference in temperature that I can use to cross calibrate my whereabouts, of where, why and what with I am spinning upon.
              as this unknown planet quakes, my new sun burns a little brighter.
              A stronger fluctuation of dense rubble could allow an initial cross calibration every organism uses to sustain an inner current.
              Time Multiplied by Time opens a whole new corridor of increments, I see what I was feeling before, Now.
              I begin to sculpt my own vessel out of my unseen matter, Still pondering on what I was before this. Unable to match anything besides the opposing surge I felt before my awareness of mathematical endeavors.
              I begin to tune in to all the sounds I felt compelled without will to avoid for so long.
              I begin to feel my own sound ripples, Without a static conflict I adjust to a mimic on other unique ripples. A form of morse code I discovered within this planet, after a quake I now feel a shift downwards as if I am still at the bottom of my new universes river.
              As I continued to ponder am I, are we, the only one? I Feel a quake and I mimic the pulse that'll come down and I hear an echo from behind as my mimic rolls at me from behind. what Liberation upon knowing I am not alone, I feel attached to something now.
              I have rooted my minds tree under a body of a warm water, I feel relaxed as stiffness melts away.
              With the morning sunrise, crusts both above and below feel warm, as my inner branches feed they begin to hone.
              Within my matter I feel time, equally and not randomly.
              With steady heat variations as my internal clock I begin to converse my time by resting in the cold dark unknown nights and by opening my intake valves during the warm light when my cells begin to feel elastic and not numb as they have for so long.
              With every morning my internal clock never misses the chance to grow by stretching I begin a layer that holds in more of my little essence, allows intake of substance and keeps by pressure neutral so I do not implode or dissipate as I only sense will happen with my common instinct.
              as I grab weighted Substances, I begin to float low at night in the cold, and float high in the heat of the day as my weighty substances expand with a dry gas substance that has started to allow me to emerge off the coast of a vast shore.
              With frictionless rotation a massive force is slowly pushing me and others in one direction, even at night I feel colder and dryer with the nights wind.
              I've been at the top, and other auras are felt pondering all around me, I even notice more vibrations colliding than before, auras are telepathically discharging upon one another so they can find one another after each quake.
              With common communication being exercised daily, and our vessels floating in one direction the surviving vessels of the countless quakes we begin to develop the ability to concentrate incoming vibrations, rather than feeling them through our entire vessel they are redirected to an incoming and outgoing side, we are now allowing binaural interaction and we begin to express our creativity through our own orchestra of inner chants.
              as my essence fades once more, the thought from our logical scientific standpoints that our universal imbalance could precede to an empty existence, with a small hollow charge from the ends of existence release one single force as time-forged matter from another clear-marble world the surge was tuned to my internal-clock reviving a creation from an eternal slumber We transform through a god like gust in an instant time merges with matter with which an unforeseen force grants a cognitive cataclysm Merging mind and sound, to a spiritual temple of bone.
              A temple of concentrated Spiritual Essences, Allowing common sense to calculate even the smallest fraction of information the universe leaves behind for our own content analysis. As time unfolds our new temples have powers beyond normal human control, as we sat with only wakes our genes where splicing with thoughts from countless other dimensions of our universe.
              with a new form of intake our bodies are stable with this planets unique gravity. With a simple command our inner-light can rapidly reduce weight, enough to float on water while sitting, and even with a deeper level of cosmic concentration our new bodies have the genetic ability of physiological shape-shifting of positively charged atoms.
              when we can hold a single conscious thought we have already reached the ends of our newest universe for the first.
              Time is as Physical as Mass.

             Wind on Water Overview
            </button>
            <p>
              Mindfulness Meditation is awareness of the present moment. It’s about living here and now. Through mindfulness meditation, you are freed from your past thoughts and experiences, there is no worry in your future you’ll just become 100% satisfied with the moment you are in now. Free from obsession of something thats out of your control and able to relax, recuperate, regenerate and relieve from the built up every day stress. There are plenty of mindfulness techniques and they are simple to use in your daily life even within 10 minutes, or even minutes.

              Sometime after your truly familiar with you’re own mind the timeframe is stretched, time moves slower but each second accomplishes more. Meditation is time consuming in some states and stances, but if you are already at ease and calm to begin with, the time consuming part dissipates. Think about it like your conscious has a subconscious and you’re subconscious has its own conscious. The line between the two are tethered, sub means its lower down, But actually once primed it can become higher in its own right. After you’re familiar with the subconscious ability, it gains its own subconscious. I like to think about the subconscious grasping to the conscious and learning to trust its higher deity.

              Somehow people are born in a 100% subconscious state of mind, slowly enough subconscious vessels of knowledge add up and allow the brain to consciously make decisions by seeing similarities and basing an outcome on previous mistakes and / or proper decisions. The weirdest thing about mindfulness meditation is not out growing yourself, like when a tree becomes top-heavy and slightest wind can knock it over or cause an uneasy sway. Our mind starts on a subconscious level, but to begin with there is no conscious. its confusing to think that the sub comes first and yet there is no level higher for it to grasp to.

              Thats like a tree growing without roots, or better yet roots growing without a tree. Accept unlike trees we are social creatures, in early stages of psychological development the subconscious mind does not have a conscious level of its own but a conscious level of social beings around it for it to mimic and shape shift into until it finds a form of comfort. Mindfulness meditation can allow someones subconscious to reach its own true potential by growing to the size of the universe rather than growing to the size of its self, which starts at an absolute zero and can reach an absolute infinity because a mind is similar to the universe, each corridor is its own black hole.

              Mindfulness meditation is one of the first meditations our brain uses subconsciously to determine reality and decipher existence as a whole. Using your consciousness to grain control of your sub corridors is important because the two are from the same essence but they want to drift apart and repel one another. Ever hear the saying opposites attracted, well in this case opposites attract and repel while forever conjoined.
              Wind is said to be the original mindful element, unforeseen and always present somewhere on earth. Patiently revolving around our earth gently touching the surface of our body of waters, trees and mountain ranges, even whistling through caverns.

              Binaural Beats allow a signal from one side of the brain to be triggered through one ear. The second ear does the parallel effect.

              Certain parts of our brain have a built in itch, its never been scratched and its never been discovered in many cases there is at least one of these little triggers waiting to be triggered by music, sounds of nature such as birds communicating with you in the middle.

              Binaural Beats are timed down to the milliseconds, ear 1 receives the signal at 0.500 second, ear 2 receives the signal anywhere from 0.450 - 0.550.

              Different sounds, signals and even ear canals take a major effect.

              typically a Binaural Beat will lose its potency, although coming back to it a year later can be like hearing it a new.

             Yuletide Yogi Overview
            </button>
            <p>
              Yoga + Kundalini are Similar in their abilities to : Obtain and Solve the imbalanced soul of flowing chemically altering bodily Auras.

              Yoga increases blood flow, allowing nutrients to process faster and vitalize the user faster.

              Snakes are one Giant muscle, they constrict and contort to reach their destination. Human muscles are the same and so are vessels in the sense of constriction. When muscles are stretched they’ll constrict easier causing less anxiety.

              Yoga allows toxins to be pushed from our body faster. Yoga also sends a signal to our brain that a muscle is dried out and needs to be replenished allowing proper daily constriction. The old cells are put into the blood and revitalized and brought back to live turning the from a toxic substance to their original  nutritious state

              Yoga of the Body and Mind

              Yoga is a physical, mental, and spiritual practice or discipline, that aims to transform body and mind. The term denotes a variety of schools, practices and goals.

              The term yoga is derived from the literal meaning of "yoking together" a span of horses or oxen, but came to be applied to the "yoking" of mind and body.

              Yoga is not a recent trend, nor is it a religion. Yoga is a systematic, ancient approach to health and well being. Yoga tones and relaxes the entire system while bringing the mind and body into perfect balance. The goal of Yoga can be summarized in three words: easeful, peaceful and useful. 

              If you are physically easeful and mentally peaceful, then you will be useful to humanity. That is the aim of Yoga. In the West, the most familiar Yoga practice is Hatha Yoga, Yoga of the physical body. This is only one part of a larger system of Yoga to make the body and mind pure and focused.

              The Integral Yoga System combines many methods of Yogic practice, integrating the many branches into a varied yet simple system.

              Alternate Nostril Breathing
              This breathing technique will help you tap into the part of the brain called the insula, which is associated with cravings as well as moral intuition, creativity and empathy.

              How: Sit cross-legged with your back supported either by the headboard or the back of the couch. Press your ring finger over your left nostril and inhale four counts through your right nostril. Then, close off your right nostril with your thumb so both sides of your nose are closed. Hold all the air for four counts. Release your ring finger and let all the air out of your left nostril for four counts. Reverse this pattern by inhaling through the left nostril, holding both closed and then exhaling out the right. Repeat this breathing pattern for three to five minutes—or until you're more interested in sweet dreams than sweet treats.

              Yoga is apart of many religions, its just known by its motion more frequently than title.

              Many forms of Meditation have different titles in other regions all over the world, many cases the initial name is changed, the roots of purpose remain the same but.. oddly the technique evolves into its own.

              History is hard to calculate properly, in many cases a hypothesis based off of old artifacts or remnants decide who was first to the cookie. But in many minds of historians theres a large chance of being mislead.

              Whos to say if Multiple Religions and cultures use the same technique that one of them was first and originated the concept.

              For all we know both sides originated on their own free will without any suggestions from other cultures and Their timelines never even crossed.

            <p>
              Zen Meditation is where a champion rests, after reaching a set amount of self guided stature states’ of mind the subconscious has an excess amount of stored memory, allowing a mind to expand and conserve in differences of 1x-10x of energy even in an active induced state and consumption compulsion state of imbalance true consciousness is achieved in Zen, Warriors require a certain Zen Endurance in many cultures.

              Zen Meditation allows focus on all at once, Used by monks whilst mantras flow zen meditation allows elements to come in and sooth, Guide and heal. Rather than come in and be repelled, Zen meditation is inner strength and that strength is required to obtain and sustain the next larger obstacle life throws our way. Zen meditation can turn the bad into good by Somehow reversing the negative polarity a mind has the ability to extract the good from the bad and continue to build an inner sanctuary.

              Zen meditation carries multiple entitlements.

              Zen Meditation can be used in a pure sense or one of the hybrid states.

              Instruments allow the body to connect with its mind, while still putting off a calming effect.

              Zen Instruments differ from any kind of musical utensil, Depending on the persons unique character traits.

              The most Common aborigines' zen instruments are wind.

              Wind instruments have the unique ability to allow you to hone a note for 30+ seconds without becoming distracted.

              Drums put off sharper pitches and require physical stamina resulting in movement meditation, Drums also put off a latency when struck right.

              Drums work similar to a gong, the strongest loudest point is in the center.

              When these similar zen-struments are hit in the center, the radius traveled is 100% perpendicular, on a drum its harder to notice the matching pitches colliding. 

              However on a gong you only need to hit it slightly and the vibrations within it will essentially illuminate within its habitat and grow off of the bountiful energy, its essentially a highly compressed echo.

              a Didgeridoo is more like a drum than a gong because one end is open, this is essential for physiological control also known as consciousness.
